        <h2>Lakers struggling (again)</h2>
        <p>
          James, five days short of his 37th birthday, was spectacular in scoring 39 points on Saturday and leading the Lakers’ remarkable fourth-quarter push against the Brooklyn Nets in a showcase Christmas Day game at the newly renamed Crypto.com Arena. He brought them back into a game they didn’t deserve to win, helping them erase a 20-point deficit after three quarters and bringing fans to their feet in hopes of seeing if not a Christmas miracle, at least an end to the Lakers’ losing streak.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite his herculean efforts — again — the Lakers fell short. Their 122-115 loss to the equally COVID-stricken Nets was their fifth straight defeat and a waste of the latest in a series of astonishing performances by James, who passed the late Kobe Bryant to become the NBA’s leading scorer in Christmas Day games.

          “To watch it and to be a part of it even though those games are turning into Ls, I’ve never seen anything like this guy,” interim coach David Fizdale said, “and we better sure as hell be thanking our lucky stars for this guy. He has given us the most beautiful basketball for the last however many years and he’s still giving it to us on Christmas Day.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Fizdale paused to ask if James had broken Bryant’s record, which happened late in the first half. James now has 422 points in 16 Christmas Day games. “That’s fantastic,” Fizdale said. “At least I can say I was there for that.”
